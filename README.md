## General Introduction

Traffic Jams and road congestions are one of the most prominent problems in travel. Congestions lead to higher levels of harmful emissions, 
adverse health effects and higher cost burdens. In an effort to reduce the enviromental effect of cars, the city of Zurich is actively campaigning 
for more bicycles. This is further pushed by the post-Covid popularity. This raises the question whether more bicycles will disrupt the flow of traffic or whether the higher percentage of bicycles will relieve the burden of cars on the roads.

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

- How will the change in percentage of bicycles to cars influence the travel time of the remaining cars?
- How will the change in percentage of bicycles to cars influence the travel time of the remaining bicycles?
- How will traffic density be affected?


## Expected Results

We assume that the travel time for cars will get longer, and will get shorter for bikes. We assume that the traffic density will rise, as bicycles take less space, so therefore more can use the same space.


## Research Methods

Agent Based Modelling

## Other

We are using data from OpenStreetMap. Furthermore we optimized the code to be run on HPC Clusters.
