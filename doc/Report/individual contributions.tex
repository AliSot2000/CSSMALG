\section{Individual contributions}
Sophia was in charge of research and related papers, gathering the data and the initial filtering round. Jan then further cleaned up the data and parsed it into a viable input form. This included generating the agents, that were then fed into the model. Nils wrote a preliminary draft of the code. Alexander then took the draft, expanded upon it, optimised it to be run in parallel on RACKlette, a High Performance Computing Cluster. Jannick created a web-interface to visualise the model, which was integral to debugging and also the final presentation. The report was written by Jan, Alex and Sophia, with graphs generated by Jannick. The presentation was made primarily by Jan and Sophia.
We would also like to thank Faveo HÃ¶rold, who gave us some advice on getting the simulation to run on the HPC Cluster.
